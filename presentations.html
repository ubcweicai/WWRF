							<p><h4>Speaker: Dr. Geng Wu</h4> (Chief Scientist and director of Standards and Advanced Technology at Intel Corporation)</p>
    					<p><h4>Title of Presentation: </h4> Devices and Networks for Future Embedded Mobile Internet </p>
    					<p><h4>Abstract: </h4>The wireless industry made significant progresses in the past decade by bringing billions of users and intelligent devices online. These technology innovations fundamentally transformed the ways of people and machines communicating and collaborating with each other. This trend will continue into the next decade but at a much larger scale. Since we are practically at the theoretic limit of air link design, and our frequency bands become increasingly congested, our technology focus has to shift from spectral efficiency to network efficiency and to energy efficiency. To make this technology transition even more challenging, the needs to support more complex mobile applications, the explosive growth of the number of devices, the proliferation of local and indoor computing from wearable devices, and the required commination and processing of sensor data from future intelligent society will further amplify and accelerate this process. This talk discusses the fundamental options we have to solve these problems, the research directions for Horizons 2020 and the technology challenges yet to be addressed.</p>

							<p><h4>Speaker: Dr. Robert C. Simmonds</h4> (Chairman at Lenbrook Corp.)</p>
    					<p><h4>Title of Presentation: </h4> A Brief History of Clearnet </p>
    					<p><h4>Abstract: </h4> Clearnet Communications was a major Canadian business success which continues on today as the wireless component of TELUS, Canada’s second largest telecommunications company offering service to approx 8 million subscribers. Clearnet was initially created in 1983 by Bob Simmonds, his father and partners as a nationwide wireless carrier delivering SMR services (2-way dispatch via trunked radio technology in the 806-821/851-866 MHz band). From this rather modest beginning, Clearnet pioneered ESMR and CDMA services in Canada and developed into one of Canada’s largest and pre-eminent wireless telecommunications service providers.  By 2000, Clearnet was often loosely described as the Canadian equivalent to Sprint-Nextel in the US. Clearnet was acquired by TELUS for $6.6B in October 2000, a transaction which still stands as the largest telecom deal ever done in Canada. This talk will review some of the origins and significant events and highlights of Clearnet’s evolution, as well as touch on some of Bob’s current areas of interest.</p>
    					<p><h4>Biography: </h4>Bob Simmonds is a seasoned Canadian telecommunications executive.  He was the Founder and Chairman of Clearnet Communications which pioneered 800 MHz SMR service in Canada, and launched of two state-of-the-art digital wireless networks, a national ESMR network in 1996 and Canada’s first national CDMA PCS network in 1997. In 2000, Clearnet was acquired by TELUS Corporation for $6.6 billion (CDN) in the largest telecommunications deal in Canadian history.  Bob continued to work for TELUS Mobility as its Executive Vice President, Regulatory and retired in 2006. Bob is widely regarded as one of Canada’s leading wireless communications engineers and a mobile spectrum authority, having played a key role in the development of Canada’s mobile spectrum policies, frequency bandplans and certification equipment standards for more than 30 years. Bob continues to serve as Chairman of Lenbrook Corporation, a distributor of electronics components and radio products and owner of the NAD and PSB brands of audio/video products. He is also a director of BCE/Bell Canada, Canada’s largest telecommunications and broadcasting enterprise as well as 6Harmonics, an early stage Ottawa wireless startup working on cognitive radio and dynamic spectrum access techniques. Bob continues to Chair the Mobile and Personal Communications Committee of the Radio Advisory Board of Canada (RABC), the body that provides unbiased and technically expert advice to the federal Department of Industry, and is a past Chair of the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Assocation (CWTA).  A laureate and member of Canada’s Telecommunications Hall of Fame, Mr. Simmonds earned his B.A. Sc. in Electrical Engineering at the University of Toronto.</p>

							<p><h4>Speaker: Dr. Raymond Laflamme</h4> (Executive Director in Institute for Quantum Computing at Univesity of Waterloo)</p>
    					<p><h4>Title of Presentation: </h4> Quantum Information Processing </p>
    					<p><h4>Abstract: </h4> We are at the dawn of a new technological revolution. Just as the 19th century was the Machine Age and the 20th century was the Information Age, the 21st century promises to go down as the Quantum Age. Harnessing and controlling the counterintuitive properties of quantum mechanics will enable previously unimaginable technologies that will transform the ways we work, communicate and live. Quantum information processing forces us to learn a new language — one that describes the behaviours and interactions of the universe's most fundamental building blocks. We are now learning to speak this quantum language — to control quantum systems and apply them toward unprecedented applications in the laboratory and beyond. We are discovering new ways to navigate the nano-scale world, and we are tapping into the incredible potential of quantum computers, sensors, communications devices and more. Quantum technologies are already finding real-world applications, and the fundamental groundwork is now being laid for revolutionary advances in the coming years, from ultra-powerful computers to unbreakable cryptography and more. I will describe some of the recent progress in the field, particularly in the experimental realm, such as implementations of algorithms on small quantum processors — an important demonstration of control over the quantum world. I will also mentin the development of quantum communication, in particular to cryptography and conclude by exploring some of the unexpected offshoots of quantum information research, such as advances in neutron interferometry and oil exploration. </p>
    					<p><h4>Biography: </h4>
    						Laflamme is originally from Québec City, where he studied Physics as an undergraduate at the Université Laval.  Prof. Laflamme and his colleague Don Page are responsible for having changed Hawking’s mind on the reversal of the direction of time in a contracting universe (see Hawking’s book, A Brief History of Time). After surviving Part III of the Mathematical Tripos at the University of Cambridge, Raymond Laflamme completed his PhD on aspects of general relativity and quantum cosmology in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP) under the direction of Stephen Hawking.  From 1988-1992, Laflamme held a Killam Postdoctoral fellowship at UBC, and a Postdoctoral fellowship at Peterhouse College, University of Cambridge. From 1992-2001, Prof. Laflamme worked as a research scientist at Los Alamos Research Laboratory, where his interests shifted from cosmology to quantum computing.

                Since the mid-1990s, Laflamme has developed theoretical approaches to quantum error correction, and has conducted experimental demonstrations of these techniques. In collaboration with Emmanuel Knill, Laflamme gave conditions for quantum error correcting codes, and established the fault-tolerance threshold, thereby showing that quantum computers can be robust to errors. With colleagues, he has developed a blueprint for a quantum information processor using linear optics, and devised and implemented new methods to for making quantum information robust against corruption in both cryptographic and computational settings.

                In 2001, Laflamme returned to Canada as the founding Executive Director of the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC), and as a founding member of the Perimeter Institute For Theoretical Physics. Dr. Laflamme was the Scientific Director of QuantumWorks, Canada’s national research consortium on quantum information science, and has been Director of the Quantum Information Program at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) since its inception in 2003. Dr. Laflamme holds the Canada Research Chair in Quantum Information, and is a Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Waterloo.  In 2010 he founded Universal Quantum Devices, a startup commercializing spinoffs of quantum information research, with colleagues Thomas Jennewein and Steve MacDonald.

							<p><h4>Speaker: Dr. Rolando D. Somma</h4> (Theoretical Physicist and Staff at Los Alamos National Laboratory)</p>
    					<p><h4>Title of Presentation: </h4> Quantum Computing and Quantum Communications at LANL </p>
    					<p><h4>Abstract: </h4>Two main goals in quantum information are the design of novel methods for speeding up computations and the implementation of fundamentally secure communications, by taking advantage of the surprising effects of quantum mechanics. On one side, it is now known that if a large-scale quantum computer existed today, it could solve some important problems, such as factoring, much faster than their conventional counterparts. This implies, in particular, that quantum computers play an important role in cryptography as they could break widely used encryption methods such as RSA.  On the other side, quantum mechanical effects can also be exploited to implement cryptographic protocols that are both, fundamentally secure and "future-proof". These are in contrast with conventional cryptography, for which security is solely based on computational assumptions, which makes it vulnerable against future attacks. LANL's quantum information science and technology research spans from fundamental questions of quantum theory, to quantum computation and quantum communications. We are developing fast quantum algorithms for optimization for a wide range of applications, from the simulation of quantum physical systems to combinatorial optimization, at speeds that would be otherwise impossible. We are implementing secure quantum communication networks (a quantum internet) with the goal of distributing cryptographic keys via novel authentication protocols based on secure identification and secret sharing. In this talk, I will explain some of the basics behind quantum computation and quantum communications, and summarize some of the recent LANL efforts in this rapidly growing and exciting field.</p>
    					<p><h4>Biography: </h4>
							Dr. Somma is a theoretical physicist and staff at Los Alamos National Laboratory, working on quantum information theory and condensed matter physics. Somma has a long-standing record in the field, being the coauthor of over thirty five refereed and highly cited publications in quantum algorithms, optimization, quantum cryptography, quantum metrology, and quantum phase transitions. Prior to joining LANL as a staff, Dr. Somma held a postdoctoral position at the prestigious Perimeter Institute, Waterloo, Canada. Somma is the principal investigator of two projects in quantum information that aim at exploring the advantages of quantum physics for secure communications and fast problem solving. Dr. Somma has various student and postdoctoral prizes, is affiliated to some other major institutions in the field, and is also an adjunct assistant professor at the University of New Mexico.</p>

    					<p><h4>Title of Presentation: </h4> Move Together to Stay Together </p>
    					<p><h4>Abstract: </h4> The evolution of the mobile service market has profound implications onto the lifestyle of today’s people living in the era of mobile networking – how they get information, and buy and sell goods, involve themselves in social networking and even more. The evolution is the result of something complex done in the market. However, it is notable that “technology” itself is one of the most important factors towards evolution but there’s something beyond that as we have seen the survival of certain technology in the market is not merely based on what it is. Instead of repeating the importance of technology itself, this talk is intended to provide the audience with an opportunity to build up their own insight on how to use the technology to create values in a more diverse dimension, such as how “people” will behave in the market – to create new mobile services which are richer, more secure, and convenient to use in the right situation of every instant in our daily life. Having these huge potential opportunities in mind, this talk will discuss a wide range of brand-new mobile service features and how they are expected to be in the market if supply and demand want to stay together.  </p>

    					<p><h4>Title of Presentation: </h4>Indoor to Outer space: theory and experiments in optical wireless communications</p>
    					<p><h4>Abstract: </h4>Due to the increasing scarcity of RF spectrum and growing interference due to multiple users, deploying next generation high-speed wireless networks is becoming increasingly difficult.  The use of unlicensed optical bands for wireless communications has been heralded as an exciting development for future broadband access.
						This talk provides an overview of the research into optical wireless systems taking place at the Free-space Optical Communication Algorithms Laboratory (FOCAL) at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.  The main thrusts of the group will be highlighted by emphasizing three recent contributions.  Firstly, some details of a 2 km free-space optical test bench facility will be presented along with experimental results in radio-over-FSO transmission of DVB-T signals.  Secondly,  some fundamental results on the capacity-achieving distributions of discrete-time Poisson channels under both peak and average amplitude constraints will be given as well as a practical coding scheme to approach capacity.  Such channels model long range inter-satellite laser communication links operating over many thousands of kilometres.  Finally, details of signal design for bandlimited optical intensity channels using a new approach, i.e., optical impulse modulation, will be reviewed.  Such channels can be found in indoor diffuse infrared channels as well as visible light communication systems.  The talk will conclude with a brief overview of other ongoing research directions.

These technology innovations fundamentally transformed the ways of people and machines communicating and collaborating with each other. This trend will continue into the next decade but at a much larger scale. Since we are practically at the theoretic limit of air link design, and our frequency bands become increasingly congested, our technology focus has to shift from spectral efficiency to network efficiency and to energy efficiency. To make this technology transition even more challenging, the needs to support more complex mobile applications, the explosive growth of the number of devices, the proliferation of local and indoor computing from wearable devices, and the required commination and processing of sensor data from future intelligent society will further amplify and accelerate this process. This talk discusses the fundamental options we have to solve these problems, the research directions for Horizons 2020 and the technology challenges yet to be addressed.</p>

							<p><h4>Speaker: Dr. BO THIDÉ </h4> (Professor at Swedish Institute of Space Physics)</p>
							<p><h4>Title of Presentation: </h4>Angular Momentum Radio - Principles and Techniques </p>
    					<p><h4>Abstract: </h4>The increasing congestion of the radio frequency bands imposes serious
  limitations on the capacity and capability of existing wireless
  information infrastructures mainly based on the use of the physical
  observable electromagnetic linear momentum, a conserved quantity
  (constant of motion).  Our approach to overcome these limitations is
  to enable a frequency re-use by exploiting other physical conserved
  observables carried by the electromagnetic field, such as angular
  momentum.  The general, fundamental physical principles of the use of
  the orbital part of the EM angular momentum (OAM) in radio
  communications will be described.

  While the increase of channel capacity by using OAM states was
  demonstrated in the optical regime recently, the receiving antennas in
  commercial radio links have a much smaller extent than the transmitted
  beam, making the signal reception and characterization of the OAM
  state demanding.  Moreover, radio data transmission with N channels
  per polarisation state at the same frequency for radio links when N>2
  is known to be notoriously difficult to realise even with multiport
  techniques, long antenna baselines and digital post-processing.  We
  will report results from an outdoor experiment where the physical
  properties of OAM states were used to transfer information, using
  far-field multiplexing/demultiplexing of N=3 coexisting, collinear,
  vertically polarised and mutually independent OAM radio beams, opening
  new perspectives in wireless telecommunications. </p>
     					<p><h4>Biography: </h4>
							Bo Thidé is a Swedish physicist who studies radio waves and other electromagnetic radiation in space, particularly their interaction with matter and fields. He received his B.Sc. in 1972, his M.Sc. in 1973, and defended his Ph.D. thesis at Uppsala University in 1979. His Ph.D. was obtained under the supervision of professor Per Olof Fröman at the Department of Theoretical Physics, Uppsala University. He has worked at the Swedish Institute of Space Physics in Uppsala since 1980, where he has been a professor since 2000. In 1981, Bo Thidé discovered electromagnetic emissions stimulated by powerful radio waves in the ionosphere during experiments in August 1981 at the EISCAT facility in Tromsø, Norway.[1] For the first time it was shown that the plasma turbulence excited by powerful radio waves in the ionosphere radiates secondary electromagnetic radiation that can be detected and analysed on the ground. These stimulated electromagnetic emissions (SEE) exhibit a rich spectral structure, particularly near harmonics of the ionospheric electron gyro frequency. The SEE technique is now a useful tool in plasma turbulence research. For his discovery, Thidé was awarded the Edlund Prize of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1991.</p>
